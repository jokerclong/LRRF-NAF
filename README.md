# MSRRA-NAF: Multi-Scale Relative Resolution Attention-Guided X-Ray 3D Reconstruction via Neural Attenuation Field
## Introduction
This study describes a multi-scale relative resolution attention-guided x-ray three-dimensional reconstruction framework based on neural attenuation field (MSRRA-NAF), which is mainly applied in the three-dimensional reconstruction of medical images.
